# 🚀 Chat Application in C++ (OOP)

## 📖 Introduction
This is a **Chat Application** built in C++ using Object-Oriented Programming (OOP). It allows users to:
- **Sign up / Log in** to the server.
- **Create public and private chat rooms.**
- **Send and receive messages** in real-time.
- **Manage user lists in chat rooms.**

The application is developed using **C++**, utilizing **TCP/IP Sockets** for communication between client and server

## ⚙️ Features
### Client:
- Sign up, log in, and authenticate users with the server.
- Create and join public or private chat rooms (with room key).
- Real-time messaging within chat rooms.
- Display the list of users in the current chat room.

### Server:
- Manage multiple client connections using **std::thread**.
- Authenticate users and store account information securely.
- Manage public and private chat rooms.
- Broadcast messages to all users in a chat room.
- Optimized message processing with the updated `Account`, `Message`, and `RoomChat` classes.

### User Interface (GUI):
- Display notifications, loading effects, and option menus.
- Utilize **ANSI Escape Codes** for color-changing and cursor manipulation on Linux terminal.

## 🧩 Class Design
### 1. **Account (Server Side):**
- Manages user authentication, registration, and login status.
- Uses file storage for account information.
- Supports parsing and validating message formats.

### 2. **Message (Server Side):**
- Handles encryption and decryption of messages.
- Extracts usernames and message content.
- Manages message formatting for broadcasting.

### 3. **Server (Server Side):**
- Manages client connections using **std::thread**.
- Authenticates users and manages sessions.
- Coordinates messaging and broadcasting using `Message` and `Account`.
- Manages public and private chat rooms.

### 4. **RoomChat (Client Side):**
- Manages chat rooms (public and private) on the client side.
- Handles joining, leaving, and notifying users in the room.
- Stores chat history and displays real-time messages.

### 5. **Client (Client Side):**
- Manages connection to the server and user authentication.
- Navigates chat rooms using `RoomChat` objects.
- Handles sending and receiving messages in real-time.

### 6. **GUI (Client Side):**
- Displays terminal-based UI using **ANSI Escape Codes**.
- Provides loading effects, notification boxes, option menus, and other console effects.

## 💻 Installation and Execution
### 1. **Requirements:**
- `g++` compiler (supporting C++11 or later)
- `make` (optional)
- `Ws2_32` library for socket programming on Windows


### 2. **Compile and Run on Windows (MinGW):**
- **Compile Client:**
```sh
g++ -o client.exe main.cpp Account.cpp Message.cpp RoomChat.cpp -lWs2_32 -std=c++11 -pthread
```
- **Run Client:**
```sh
client.exe
```

- **Compile Server:**
```sh
g++ -o server.exe Server.cpp Account.cpp Message.cpp RoomChat.cpp -lWs2_32 -std=c++11 -pthread
```
- **Run Server:**
```sh
server.exe
```

---

## 🔨 Usage
### 1. **Start the Server:**
- In the terminal, navigate to the source directory and run:
```sh
server.exe # Windows
```
- The server will listen on port `8080`.

### 2. **Start the Client:**
- In another terminal, run:
```sh
client.exe # Windows
```
- Log in or sign up for a new account.
- Select `New room chat` to create a new room or `Available room chat` to join an existing room.
- Start chatting in the room.
